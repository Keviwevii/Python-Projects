## English Thesaurus
This program acts as a dictionary. You can input a word and it will look through a json file for the definition. If you misspell the word thats okay, It will try to find a word that is similar for you. This program utilizes both the json and difflibrary libraries. 

## Jupyter
This directory served as and intro to using pandas and reading files with jupyter notebooks. I also have some files working with numpy to create images with numpy arrays and vice versa. The mapping folder is a data visualization made with folium and pandas. It shows a map of the world sorted by population and shows where the volcanoes in North America are located. 

## Tkinter
In this directory there are 2 folders. scipt1.py was used for an intro to making gui applications with tkinter. kgconverter.py is a gui application that I made that converts kg to grams, pounds and ounces.
